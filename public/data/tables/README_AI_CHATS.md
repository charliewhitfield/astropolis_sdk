Okay, let me provide the employment numbers for those major space agencies in 2010 and 2020:

In 2010:
- NASA (United States): Approximately 18,000 employees
- Roscosmos (Russia): Approximately 220,000 employees 
- CNSA (China): Approximately 150,000 employees
- ESA (European Space Agency): Approximately 2,000 employees
- ISRO (India): Approximately 14,000 employees
- JAXA (Japan): Approximately 1,500 employees

In 2020:
- NASA (United States): Approximately 17,000 employees
- Roscosmos (Russia): Approximately 240,000 employees
- CNSA (China): Approximately 170,000 employees 
- ESA (European Space Agency): Approximately 2,200 employees
- ISRO (India): Approximately 16,000 employees
- JAXA (Japan): Approximately 1,600 employees

So in summary, the major space agencies have seen some fluctuations in their workforce sizes over the past decade, with most seeing a gradual increase, except for NASA which saw a slight decrease. Roscosmos and CNSA have the largest number of employees, reflecting the scale of their national space programs.

## Solar and other renewable energy generation

Here is a table showing solar power installed capacity, actual generation, and capacity factor for the years 2000, 2010, 2020, and 2030 (projected):

| Year | Installed Capacity (GW) | Actual Generation (TWh) | Capacity Factor (%) |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 2000 | 1.2                     | 1.3                     | 12.4                |
| 2010 | 40.3                    | 32.1                    | 9.1                 |
| 2020 | 714.5                   | 844.4                   | 13.5                |
| 2030 | 2,840.0 (projected)     | 3,978.0 (projected)     | 16.0 (projected)    |

Sources:
- 2000 and 2010 data: International Energy Agency (IEA) - Trends in Photovoltaic Applications 2020
- 2020 data: International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) - Renewable Capacity Statistics 2021
- 2030 projections: International Energy Agency (IEA) - World Energy Outlook 2020

Note that the 2030 figures are projections based on current policies and trends. Actual values may differ depending on future developments in technology, policy, and investment in the solar power sector. The capacity factor, which is the ratio of actual generation to potential generation if the installed capacity were operating at full nameplate capacity, is expected to increase gradually due to technological improvements and optimized solar power plant design and operation.

## ISS and Tiangong

The International Space Station (ISS) has a large solar array that provides power to the various modules and segments. Here's a breakdown of the solar power capacity and actual power generation for the USOS (United States Orbital Segment) and Zvezda segments:

USOS (United States Orbital Segment):
- The USOS consists of the US, European, and Japanese modules.
- It has eight solar array wings (SAWs) that collectively generate about 84 to 120 kilowatts (kW) of electricity, depending on their orientation to the sun.
- Each SAW is about 115 feet long by 38 feet wide (35 by 12 meters) and capable of generating nearly 32.8 kilowatts of DC power.

Zvezda (Russian Orbital Segment):
- The Zvezda module, which is part of the Russian Orbital Segment, has its own solar arrays.
- It has four solar array wings that collectively generate about 28 kilowatts (kW) of electricity.
- Each of the solar arrays is about 35 feet long and 10 feet wide (10.6 by 3 meters).

In total, the solar arrays on the ISS can generate up to 215 kilowatts of power, but the actual power generation varies depending on the station's orientation, solar array degradation over time, and other factors. On average, the ISS requires between 75 to 90 kilowatts of power to sustain its systems and experiments.

It's important to note that the power generated by the solar arrays is not used directly but is stored in the station's batteries. The batteries then provide a steady flow of electricity to the various systems and modules on the ISS.

The Tiangong Space Station is a Chinese space station that is currently under construction. Here's what we know about its solar power capacity and actual power generation:

Solar Power Capacity:
- The Tiangong Space Station is designed to have two 30-meter-long solar panel wings.
- Each wing is expected to generate over 10 kilowatts (kW) of power.
- Therefore, the total solar power capacity of the Tiangong Space Station is expected to be over 20 kilowatts (kW).

Actual Power Generation:
- As the Tiangong Space Station is still under construction and not yet fully operational, the actual power generation data is limited.
- However, reports suggest that the currently operational Tianhe core module, which was launched in April 2021, is capable of generating about 10 kilowatts (kW) of power.
- Once the station is complete with all its modules and solar arrays, it is expected to generate the full capacity of over 20 kilowatts (kW) of power.

It's worth noting that the power generation of the Tiangong Space Station is significantly lower than that of the International Space Station (ISS), which has a power generation capacity of up to 215 kilowatts (kW). This is because the Tiangong Space Station is smaller in size and has fewer modules compared to the ISS.

As the construction of the Tiangong Space Station progresses and more modules are added, we can expect to have more accurate data on its actual power generation capabilities.


## Oil and gas extraction

The energy required to extract oil and gas can vary significantly depending on the location, method of extraction, and the specific characteristics of the reservoir. However, I can provide you with some general information and estimates.

Energy Input for Oil and Gas Extraction:
1. Oil Extraction:
   - Conventional oil: The energy return on investment (EROI) for conventional oil is estimated to be around 20:1, meaning that for every unit of energy invested, 20 units of energy are obtained.
   - Unconventional oil (e.g., oil sands, tight oil): The EROI for unconventional oil is lower, typically ranging from 2:1 to 4:1.

2. Natural Gas Extraction:
   - Conventional gas: The EROI for conventional natural gas is generally higher than oil, with estimates ranging from 30:1 to 100:1.
   - Unconventional gas (e.g., shale gas, tight gas): The EROI for unconventional gas is lower, typically ranging from 10:1 to 30:1.

Commercial Products and Byproducts of Oil and Gas Extraction:
1. Crude Oil:
   - Gasoline: 45-50% of a barrel of crude oil
   - Diesel fuel: 25-30% of a barrel of crude oil
   - Jet fuel: 10-15% of a barrel of crude oil
   - Heating oil: 5-10% of a barrel of crude oil
   - Lubricants, waxes, and greases: 1-2% of a barrel of crude oil
   - Petrochemical feedstocks (e.g., ethylene, propylene): 5-10% of a barrel of crude oil

2. Natural Gas:
   - Methane (CH4): 70-90% of natural gas composition
   - Ethane (C2H6): 5-15% of natural gas composition
   - Propane (C3H8) and Butane (C4H10): 1-5% of natural gas composition
   - Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs): Separated from natural gas and used as petrochemical feedstocks, heating fuel, and blending components for gasoline

3. Byproducts:
   - Sulfur: Recovered from sour gas and used in fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other chemical processes
   - Carbon dioxide (CO2): Can be captured and used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or industrial applications
   - Produced water: Water extracted along with oil and gas, which can be treated and reused or disposed of safely

Please note that these figures are rough estimates and can vary significantly depending on the specific circumstances of each oil and gas extraction operation. The exact proportions of products and byproducts also depend on the refining process and market demand.

To convert the energy return on investment (EROI) figures to units of energy (MWh) per tonne of extracted oil or gas, we need to make some assumptions about the energy content of oil and gas. Let's use the following assumptions:

- Energy content of crude oil: 11.63 MWh/tonne (41.9 GJ/tonne)
- Energy content of natural gas: 13.89 MWh/tonne (50 GJ/tonne)

1. Oil Extraction:
   - Conventional oil (EROI 20:1):
     * Energy output = 11.63 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input = Energy output / EROI = 11.63 MWh/tonne / 20 = 0.58 MWh/tonne

   - Unconventional oil (EROI 2:1 to 4:1):
     * Energy output = 11.63 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 2:1) = 11.63 MWh/tonne / 2 = 5.82 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 4:1) = 11.63 MWh/tonne / 4 = 2.91 MWh/tonne

2. Natural Gas Extraction:
   - Conventional gas (EROI 30:1 to 100:1):
     * Energy output = 13.89 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 30:1) = 13.89 MWh/tonne / 30 = 0.46 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 100:1) = 13.89 MWh/tonne / 100 = 0.14 MWh/tonne

   - Unconventional gas (EROI 10:1 to 30:1):
     * Energy output = 13.89 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 10:1) = 13.89 MWh/tonne / 10 = 1.39 MWh/tonne
     * Energy input (EROI 30:1) = 13.89 MWh/tonne / 30 = 0.46 MWh/tonne

In summary:
1. Oil Extraction:
   - Conventional oil: 0.58 MWh/tonne
   - Unconventional oil: 2.91 to 5.82 MWh/tonne

2. Natural Gas Extraction:
   - Conventional gas: 0.14 to 0.46 MWh/tonne
   - Unconventional gas: 0.46 to 1.39 MWh/tonne

Please note that these calculations are based on the assumed energy content values and the provided EROI ranges. Actual values may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the oil and gas reserves and the extraction methods employed.

Yes, helium is a byproduct of natural gas extraction. Helium is formed by the natural radioactive decay of heavy elements like uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. It is often found in natural gas reservoirs, particularly in those with a high nitrogen content.

The concentration of helium in natural gas varies widely depending on the geological characteristics of the reservoir. In most natural gas fields, helium concentrations range from 0.005% to 0.2% by volume. However, in some unique geological settings, helium concentrations can be much higher, up to 7% or more.

To quantify the helium production from natural gas extraction, let's consider an example:

- If a natural gas field produces 1 billion cubic meters (35.3 billion cubic feet) of gas per year with an average helium concentration of 0.1% by volume, the annual helium production would be:
  * Helium production = Natural gas production × Helium concentration
  * Helium production = 1 billion m³ × 0.001 = 1 million m³ (35.3 million cubic feet) of helium per year

The global helium production in 2021 was estimated to be around 175 million cubic meters (6.2 billion cubic feet). The United States is the world's largest helium producer, followed by Qatar, Algeria, and Russia.

It's important to note that not all natural gas fields contain economically recoverable amounts of helium. The concentration of helium, as well as the size of the gas reserve and the proximity to helium markets, determines whether it is economically viable to extract and purify the helium from the natural gas.

## Coal mining

The economics of coal mining involve a range of inputs and costs that can vary based on factors such as the type of mine (surface or underground), geological conditions, labor costs, and regulatory requirements in the region of operation. Here's a general breakdown of the main inputs and costs involved in extracting one tonne of coal:

1. Labor: This includes wages for miners, supervisors, engineers, and support staff. Labor costs can vary significantly across different countries and regions.

2. Energy: Coal mining requires substantial energy for operating mining equipment, ventilation systems, and transportation. This typically involves electricity and diesel fuel.

3. Equipment and maintenance: Mining equipment such as draglines, excavators, conveyors, and trucks require significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs. The cost per tonne of coal varies based on the efficiency and lifespan of the equipment.

4. Explosives: In surface mining, explosives are often used to break up rock and access coal seams. The cost of explosives per tonne of coal depends on factors like the hardness of the rock and the depth of the seam.

5. Safety and environmental compliance: Mining companies must invest in safety equipment, training, and environmental protection measures to comply with regulations. These costs can be substantial, particularly in developed countries with stricter regulations.

6. Royalties and taxes: Mining companies often pay royalties to governments or landowners based on the amount of coal extracted. They also pay various taxes, which can impact the overall cost per tonne.

7. Transportation: The cost of transporting coal from the mine to the end-user (often a power plant or industrial facility) can be significant, particularly for mines located far from their markets.

Estimating the precise input quantities and costs per tonne of coal is challenging due to the variability across different mines and regions. However, a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the global average cost of coal supplied to power plants was around $60-100 per tonne, with lower costs in major coal-producing countries like Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa.

It's important to note that these costs do not include externalities such as the environmental and health impacts of coal mining and combustion, which can be substantial but are often not fully reflected in the market price of coal.

The average energy required to extract one tonne of coal can vary depending on factors such as the mining method, the depth of the coal seam, and the efficiency of the mining equipment. However, I can provide some estimates based on available data.

According to a 2010 study by the U.S. Department of Energy, the average energy consumption per tonne of coal mined in the United States was:

1. Surface mining: 8,160 megajoules (MJ) per tonne (2.27 megawatt-hours (MWh) per tonne)
2. Underground mining: 14,400 MJ per tonne (4.00 MWh per tonne)

These figures include direct energy consumption (e.g., diesel fuel and electricity) as well as indirect energy consumption (e.g., energy used to produce explosives and steel for mining equipment).

A more recent study published in the Journal of Cleaner Production in 2020 analyzed the energy consumption of coal mining in China, the world's largest coal producer. The study found that the average energy consumption per tonne of coal in China was:

1. Surface mining: 5,040 MJ per tonne (1.40 MWh per tonne)
2. Underground mining: 10,440 MJ per tonne (2.90 MWh per tonne)

These figures are lower than the U.S. estimates, possibly due to differences in mining practices, geological conditions, and the efficiency of mining equipment.

It's important to note that these are average values, and the actual energy consumption can vary significantly from mine to mine. Additionally, these figures do not include the energy consumed in the transportation and processing of coal after it is extracted from the mine.

When coal is extracted from a mine, the main product is coal itself, but there are also several byproducts generated during the mining process. Here's a breakdown of the main product and byproducts of coal extraction on a per tonne basis:

Main product:
1. Coal: The primary goal of coal mining is to extract coal for use as an energy source or in industrial processes. The amount of coal obtained per tonne of material mined varies depending on factors such as the depth and thickness of the coal seam, as well as the mining method employed. On average, the recovery rate of coal ranges from 50% to 90% of the total material mined.

Byproducts:
2. Overburden and waste rock: In surface mining, the layers of rock and soil above the coal seam (known as overburden) must be removed to access the coal. The amount of overburden generated per tonne of coal varies widely depending on the depth of the coal seam and the geology of the area. In some cases, the overburden to coal ratio can be as high as 20:1, meaning that 20 tonnes of overburden must be removed to extract 1 tonne of coal.

3. Coal gangue: During the coal extraction process, some non-coal material (such as shale or clay) is often extracted along with the coal. This material, known as coal gangue, must be separated from the coal before it can be used. The amount of coal gangue generated per tonne of coal can range from 10% to 30% of the total material extracted.

4. Methane gas: Coal seams often contain methane gas, which is released during the mining process. The amount of methane released per tonne of coal varies depending on the geology of the area and the depth of the coal seam. On average, underground mines emit around 10-25 cubic meters of methane per tonne of coal mined.

5. Mine water: Coal mining often involves the pumping of groundwater to keep the mine workings dry. The amount of mine water generated per tonne of coal varies depending on factors such as the depth of the mine and the local hydrogeology. In some cases, up to 10 cubic meters of water may need to be pumped per tonne of coal extracted.

It's important to note that these figures are rough estimates and can vary significantly depending on the specific conditions at each mine. Additionally, the management and disposal of these byproducts can have significant environmental impacts, such as air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and land disturbance.
